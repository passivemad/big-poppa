   <h2 style = "text-align:left-side; color:green;"><u>THE RULES</u></h2>
  <p>Joining is entirely your choice, but if you do join, there are rules to follow.
    You'll find these rules in the #da-rulez channel at the top. It is advised to read the rules before you do anything else in the server. If you break any of the rules, then you <strong>WILL</strong> be punished, no exceptions. Ban appeals may be available soon, but not right now. Admins and mods are <strong>not</strong> exempt from the rules. Break any, and you will lose your role.</p>
